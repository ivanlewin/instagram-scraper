“I got the idea for The #AllowMe Movement in my freshman year of college. I wanted to put it in spaces and cities where LGBTQ youth of color could benefit from it. So many people when I’m pitching will say ‘well, there’s already programs like that.’ Not for Black and Brown people.⠀

“We try to connect with students to show them people outside of stereotypical careers. Just because you’re Queer and Black does not mean you have to be a stylist or a make-up artist or that you have to go into the arts. You can be Black and Queer and a doctor, but a lot of students aren’t hearing those messages.⠀
⠀
“My ultimate goal is for folks to be able to dictate what their freedom looks like. No longer making decisions based on choosing between safety and happiness. My work helps to embolden the voiceless, educate those who lack the resources and gives access to the folks who aren’t invited to the table.”⠀

“I started in the LBGTQ+ community in my teenage years. In the Village, we have different groups, houses in the ballroom scene. Being on the Pier, you’d see the different houses voguing against each other, dancing and playing double-dutch and stuff.

“I use my voice to be visible and stand up for injustices against discrimination of LGBTQ+ people and killing of trans people.

“I started in the LBGTQ+ community in my teenage years. In the Village, we have different groups, houses in the ballroom scene. Being on the Pier, you’d see the different houses voguing against each other, dancing and playing double-dutch and stuff. As the night came, the wee hours of the morning came, people would still be out there. And I realized these people don’t have homes. They stay outside. Like literally outside. ⠀
⠀
“Eventually I started a non-profit [that supports homeless trans people]. My ultimate goal is to have housing for all. It is a human right to have shelter. ⠀
⠀
“I use my voice to be visible and stand up for injustices against discrimination of LGBTQ+ people and killing of trans people. My advice to activists that want to make their voices heard is to keep the focus on the people. Do not take it to heart, the negative and disrespect that comes with this work. There are people that don’t like us, and will never understand who we are.”⠀
